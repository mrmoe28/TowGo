# TowGo Infrastructure Improvements

This document summarizes the infrastructure improvements made to the TowGo repository and deployment configuration.

## Repository Size Optimization

The repository size was reduced from 1.1GB to approximately 14MB by:

1. Removing unnecessary build artifacts and large files
2. Configuring proper .gitignore rules
3. Using Git LFS for large binary files
4. Implementing cleanup scripts to remove sensitive data and reduce repository size

## Security Enhancements

### GitHub Authentication

- Replaced hardcoded GitHub tokens with environment variable-based authentication
- Created `update-git-config.sh` script to securely configure Git credentials
- Added `test-git-token.sh` to verify secure token usage
- Removed sensitive credentials from Git history using BFG tool

### Environment Variables

- Ensured all sensitive information is stored in environment variables
- Created proper documentation for required environment variables
- Implemented checks to verify environment variables before running critical scripts

## Deployment Configuration

### Vercel Deployment

- Created optimized `vercel-build-new.sh` script for proper build process
- Updated `vercel.json` with correct routes and file paths
- Enhanced server configuration in `server.js` for proper static file handling in Vercel environment
- Improved error handling and debugging in deployment process

### Directory Structure

- Implemented automatic creation of necessary directories for Vercel deployment
- Added proper file path handling to ensure assets are served correctly
- Ensured compatibility between development and production environments

## Documentation

- Updated `GITHUB_SETUP.md` with secure GitHub authentication methods
- Enhanced `VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT_UPDATED.md` with detailed deployment instructions
- Added troubleshooting guides for common deployment issues

## Performance Optimizations

- Improved server configuration to handle static assets more efficiently
- Enhanced build process to create optimized production bundles
- Implemented proper paths for serving assets in various environments

## Next Steps

Areas that could be further improved:

1. Setting up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment
2. Implementing caching strategies for better performance
3. Further optimizing asset delivery and loading times
4. Adding monitoring and alerting for application health
