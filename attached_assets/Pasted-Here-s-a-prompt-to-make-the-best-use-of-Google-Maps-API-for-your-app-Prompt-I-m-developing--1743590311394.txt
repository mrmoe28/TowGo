Here's a prompt to make the best use of Google Maps API for your app:

**Prompt:**

"I'm developing an app that requires location-based services using the Google Maps API. Here are my specific requirements:

- **User Experience**: I want to ensure a smooth, fast UI performance, especially when users interact with the map. How can I optimize the map's performance for both desktop and mobile users?

- **Customization**: I need to add custom markers, overlays, and possibly custom styling to the map. Can you provide guidance on how to implement these features effectively?

- **API Key Management**: What are the best practices for securing my Google Maps API key within my app, especially considering the app will be deployed on Replit?

- **Real-time Data**: I'm interested in integrating real-time data like traffic, weather, or earthquake information. What's the best approach to do this, and how can I ensure it doesn't impact performance?

- **Cost Optimization**: Given the potential high costs associated with frequent API calls, how can I optimize my usage to reduce expenses while maintaining functionality?

- **Error Handling**: How should I handle scenarios where geolocation is not available or fails?

- **Deployment**: What are the steps to deploy my app with Google Maps integration on Replit, ensuring all dependencies are correctly managed?

Please provide detailed steps, code snippets, and any additional tips or best practices for integrating Google Maps into my app built on Replit."
